One other note, btw: your observations ab Japan are spot-on; it's definitely a cultural thing and Japan has only been able to maintain that culture bc they're so culturally homogenous.\n\nIn a land like the US where we have ppl from all over, it becomes a much more difficult project. It's like you noted towards the end: I think all people hate \"being the sucker\". Like, it's very difficult to continue going above & beyond when you see everyone around you not upholding the same standard. So then, over time, you too will then stop installing dog bag dispensers & so forth.\n\nAnyway, TY for fighting the good fight. \"ü´°\""

Some are ad hominem (but I just insta-block them) but others are thoughtful ppl who take the time to reply w/ useful info. This is in stark contrast to X where I basically get no replies ever. (But X is still enormously useful as a public recording platform.)\n\nAnyway, I'll keep experimenting with bsky. One really cool thing ab that platform is that API integration is *super-easy*. ie. It's very simple to programmatically post (w/ images) to the platform. I'm going to play around w/ this more. But basically, I think there's value in being able to \"write once & post everywhere\". X & Bsky are essentially increasingly the \"messaging busses\" of humanity.\n\nProps to what @aworkinglibrary wrote: I really encourage folks to try distributing snippets of their writing on the different major social platforms. There is definitely something fertile & promising to be explored w/ this means of distribution."

And while I'm willing to try it out (pls do share the 100 open-ended Qs, Ben!), I am skeptical bc I believe that for all ppl, even prolific writers w/ the fecundity of DFW across all domains & formats (magazine spreads, novels, personal letters) that so much of what makes us, us, is still captured in unstructured memories & experiences that are only in our latent consciousness.\n\nNotably, this is completely different than simply \"jogging\" a memory. The reason jogging a memory works is bc you have the fundamental, original memory to return to. And AI will not have that; AI only has whatever you trained it on. So whatever \"resurrection\" you may conjure will always be a poor facsimile, unable to fully capture the fidelity of the original.\n\nNow: if AI wearables/apps (Friend pendant, Rewind app, Meta Raybans, the cowboy hats in Westworld) catch on and the AIs start recording everything in your life experience from birth, then we're closer. But even then, the question now turns into a BF Skinner behaviorism question. Is the sum of a person everything you can simply observe via their exteriority? Or is there some interiority ‚Äîsome part of the human soul‚Äî that is always hidden, never outwardly observable?"

I was one of the lucky ones so the outage was only ~5:45p to ab midnight. It was still a weird evening though. I was literally typing one of my final Slack messages for work for the week when the grid went. (I just finished typing it on my phone & sending it; the draft had synced flawlessly! TY, Salesforce! Keeping work uninterrupted even as civilization crumbled! \"üí™\") And luckily, there were still a few hours of daylight left. We got dinner at a nearby sushi place (that'd been unaffected, somehow) & then bought some candles & returned home.\n\nI really enjoyed the downtime, personally. I even got some writing done on my phone which still had 4G. Obviously, I don't want rolling blackouts every week. But the whole ~6 hour experience made me think that the Jewish with their Shabbat practice are onto something, as are the Amish & their disinclination/selective use of electricity. I haven't put all the pieces together yet, but last night when we all returned to basics, we regained something raw, fundamental, and human. (To be clear though, I'm glad the return was short enough so none of the food in our fridge spoiled.) Still, it was long enough to shake me from my weekly Friday evening routine stupor. Thank you, Universe!! \"üôè\"\"üåå\""

Three big challenges according to @NoahRFeldman & @ahall_research for exercising democracy on a global platform:\n\n1. Trolls who lack skin in the game (the \"Boaty McBoatface\" problem). Also: general lack of participation often selects for ppl w/ extreme preferences.\n\n2. Who gets to decide the policy? eg. The definitions of X or Y or Z? Geographically, laws make sense bc ppl can't easily relocate for advantage (eg. for a school district for their kids). But with VPNs, if policies simply changed based on your IP, things will get hyper-balkanized quickly.\n\n3. Who is the denominator? Voting is a means of self-determination & governance for a local population. eg. New Yorkers care ab congestion pricing bc that directly affects their QoL in Manhattan. Both drivers & non-drivers alike are affected.\n\nBut on a global platform, what is the \"local population\" that voting is meant to serve?"

We all worked 5d a week at the office before. We can certainly do it again. Yes, individuals (especially parents of young children) may struggle more. And yes, I even grant some of you may be *less* productive at the office. But in my mind, all the benefits to the *surrounding office areas* are worth it. More money for small businesses like cafes and restaurants. More people doing stuff outside together after work bc they're already out. More foot traffic revitalizing our downtown urban cores or even the areas surrounding office parks. The list goes on and on.\n\nUltimately, I just don't want to live in a dystopian world where everyone's WFH and society is atomized. I want a society that is vibrant, connected, and alive!

The first time you learn a new framework or write a new app, you write so much extra code. All superfluous & loc you eventually discard.

(Or at least some ritual where you quiet your mind & baseline on what you genuinely want, filtering all the noise from signal in your head.) Additionally: this is why forming the right habits are critical. The idea is to get to a place where you 24/7 leverage your own limited perception & human biases in your favor. So your narrow cone of perception then synchronizes between your \"internal state\" & \"the external world\".\n\nWhen this happens, every \"setback\" in the external world will be exactly that in your mind: in air quotes. Your mind will interpret every setback as a lesson or opportunity. And every gift or door that opens will feel divinely ordained, feeding your confirmation bias that you're \"on the right path\".\n\nRelated: on X, I've noticed that people like to dunk on \"copes\" a lot. And I agree that a rationalization ab something suboptimal can certainly be the first step towards an unhealthy cope. But if that rationalization turns into the basis for action, then you've turned the tables. There's that old line about, \"chips on the shoulder yield chips in the pocket.\" Turn a bad childhood upbringing into a struggle essay that gets you into a selective college. Or use that speeding ticket as a constant reminder that you should drive safer when your kids are in the backseat. Copes can become lemonade if you action on them. Make your copes serve you.\n\nOne final note: someone else in the comments mentioned something ab, \"working hard\". Working hard is not enough. This is the entire idea of \"mind magic\". You need to actually put a destination into the nav system first before you enable autopilot. Otherwise, you will go through life as an NPC."

Traditional b-school models of adding modularity & management layers dilutes a founder's spirit & intentionality. A company dies when it loses its spirit. \"Founder Mode\" is a way to keep that spirit alive by having the founder not just micromanaging but seeming to \"be\" everywhere all the time.\n\nMore specifically, a company doesn't die all at once. It dies gradually. As orgs scale, people stop pushing as hard as they once did. They have families and develop new priorities. Rigor slowly decreases. So forth.\n\nTo fight this organizational calcification requires tremendous intentionality. Founder Mode is a way of keeping one's hand on the rudder for as long as possible as the boat grows and grows, and keeps getting faster."

(Tactically, I've found ~90 min one-way to be optimal; so ~3 hrs round-trip.) Pick a spot somewhere new on the map to visit. Walk around downtown. Visit a small cafe or shop. Buy a small souvenir.

Yes, only a tiny fraction would pay this tax. But in order to foot the tax bill every year, the ultra-wealthy would need to come up w/ the cash some way, right? And they'd likely sell stock? Thus, anyone who has a 401k, IRA, or any money invested in the market would also be adversely impacted.\n\nAdditionally, nowadays, more & more ppl are increasingly invested in the equity markets (thanks, Robinhood!) It used to be very gatekept (there were transaction fees on every trade!) but now with commission-free trading, anyone can participate in the spoils of a booming market.\n\nI'm honestly confused by ppl who are advocating for this; taxing unrealized capital gains seems like the exact opposite of a \"rising tide lifts all boats\". Equity markets are one of the few ways for normal people (Main Streeters) to amass great wealth in the US. Why take away this avenue of success from everyone?"

    "tweetText": "The Broad and Narrow Way (1883)\n\nI love this painting so much & it increasingly resonates as I get older. Its original context is from the bible. But I've personally interpreted the art more as the difference between leading a life w/ specific values versus one without.\n\nLiving a life with rigid values means you will lead a narrower life, one where you meet fewer people & partake in fewer life experiences. But it also means you lead, in a way, an easier life. Your decisions are easier because you have specific values that you can easily fall back on. You're not conflicted bc the way forward is always clear. (The canonical example I always think of are vegetarians: they'll never know what meat tastes like, but they'll always know what they want to eat.)\n\nLiving a life with more relaxed values means the opposite: yes, you'll experience more of what life has to offer. But the tradeoff for that flexibility is that you'll spin a lot of cycles trying to navigate difficult dilemmas and have to proportionately make tougher choices. You'll often be internally conflicted. And you'll often be more lost, bc you've chosen a life that requires more wandering.\n\nTo be clear, there is no right and wrong camp. And it obviously can change too, depending on your life stage. I personally know people in both camps who report and present as perfectly happy. It all just depends on your own specific disposition and most people live on a spectrum somewhere between the two poles.\n\nPersonally, for me: when I was younger, I was definitely more in the \"rigid values\" camp. \"A is A\". Right and wrong were always very clear to me. Then as I got older --specifically, after I got married-- I gave up on many of my values (the old adage about \"you can be principled or you can be married\") and wandered the desert for a while. But now I'm even older and have gotten some time to recalibrate to married life (it's essentially comparable to going from straightforward Euclidean geometry to not just Riemann geometry, but n-th dimensions, seriously), I'm beginning to anchor back to having more rigid values again."

Basically, in 1974, India successfully detonated a nuclear weapon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiling_Buddha‚Ä¶) and it turns out, that'd only been possible bc of technology transfer from the US in order to give nuclear energy to India.\n\nAccording to Thiel, once a country gets nuclear energy, it actually then becomes easy to weaponize an atomic bomb. The thinking is then: since nuclear technology is so dangerous, we need to contain it as much as possible. And that's why there have actively been efforts to limit nuclear as an energy resource and slow its adoption & spread.\n\nHere's the original JRE clip: https://youtube.com/watch?v=klRb0_BAX9g&t=2970s‚Ä¶"

It's the same reason many of us back in college studied the best at the library where we all suffered & commiserated together when cramming for finals. Misery loves company. But in aggregate, can be a superpower.\n\nEven for more mature companies, speaking personally, I've noticed this of myself: when I'm at the office and am stripped of optionality, I‚Äôm more focused because there‚Äôs literally nothing else I can do. I enjoy working until a specified a time and even if I finish early, I‚Äôll then fiddle on something else work-related until it‚Äôs time to go.

To my knowledge, we don't know his specific state of mind or motivations. (His wiki entry suggests he may have suffered concussions from his years playing football in HS & college.)\n\nMore generally, these incidents ‚Äî something inscrutable happens that is just so outside the standard experience ‚Äî are Rorschach tests.

One other thing I learned ab YUL today: this airport has three terminals!

What works at a national level isn't advisable at a household level, for various reasons bc what you're optimizing for at each level is different.)\n\nI agree that for roommates & marriages, sharing common core values is paramount. \"‚úÖ\"\n\nBut when it comes to society (& here, I'm thinking ab the US, specifically), the ability to agree to disagree is critical, while still working together on other things. We must be able to get along, at least in common spaces & at the workplace.\n\nWhat religions ppl celebrate at home is their own business. But when they show up for their job at the office (or WFH when they hop on Zoom or deliver work), then it's mission-first for whatever is best for the company. (Personal values are subservient to company values at the workplace. If you don't like your company's values, don't work there.)\n\nSame goes for public spaces. In public spaces, there must be a minimum code. The great thing ab America is that these codes differ *a lot* state-by-state.\n\nIf you are more liberal & like paying higher taxes, then move to SF & CA. If you're more conservative, move to a red state. And even within states, there are huge differences too. (eg. I live in Cincinnati & we have an area called Indian Hills where the wealthy residents have their own police force & gated park. But then there are other parts of Ohio that are definitely more collective & communal. In Mason, for example, there is a huge Indian enclave. (When I lived in NJ, it was like this too. Huge Indian enclaves!) And in CA, there are also entire areas where the signage is all in Chinese. No English in sight! In America!)\n\nAmerica is vibrant & strong bc we're able to harness the best from all cultures, religions, & backgrounds. The diversity is real, not just lip service, & we ought celebrate that. (Just look at the ethnicities of many of the American athletes competing at the Olympics right now.) We have 50 states. Move to the one that most shares your values. There's enough room for all of us here."

Their sleeping patterns, diets, & every waking moment of their day center around their sport.\n\nIf you wish to be the very best in something, it means throwing balance out & going for the extreme. By definition, excellence is not achieved by normal & balanced ppl. Excellence is achieved by extremists obsessed w/ their craft & pursing being the absolute best. Training & competing at the expense of just ab all else.\n\nSometimes, I wonder: if you took that same fanaticism & discipline that professional athletes commit to their sports, but applied it to something else (coding, writing, drawing, etc), what results would that yield?"

And it is, in certain ways.\n\nBut as I've gotten older, I've also realized that being childfree is also akin to playing life on hard mode, in a few but important ways.\n\nWhen you have kids, the north star is clear. There's a clear priority for your life. And the structure's also clear. (Or at least, more clear.) For most ppl, everything is done in service of your family, with your kids being first. How much money you need to make. What kind of work you need to do to make that money. How much you need to save. All these kinds of constraints do tie you down, but they also give form & purpose to your life. They keep you grounded & tethered to reality.\n\nEvery day, if you have kids, by simply making it through the day, you have contributed to your children's development. You've answered their questions, fed them, and have helped them grow. Every day, even if you're purely moving through the world in a reactive mode, you've done something meaningful w/ your life. (Or at least, moved the needle forward in some small way. At very minimum, you're at least contributing to the future tax base of your country. You are contributing to a collective project, larger than yourself!)\n\nBut in the absence of children being the forcing function, childfree ppl need to be disciplined ab how they structure their life. Not for one day, one week, or one year. But for your entire life. Also, you have to make sure you're actually doing something w/ your life. When you're childless, it's easy to squander entire days without contributing anything to anyone."

    "tweetText": "Chinese Brand Supremacy?\n\nMaybe it was inevitable, but I've noticed an increasing number of my personal devices switch over to Chinese brands. First was my laptop yrs ago (Lenovo from Dell). Then my scooter (NIU). And now I'm considering an Open (OnePlus from Samsung). For yrs, everything was made in China (eg. your fancy MacBook) but then other companies just slapped their logo over it. But now I think China's finally getting into the international market w/ their own premium Chinese brands. (The other obvious example here is TikTok. But not me! Still on X. \"üôÇ\")\n\nAs of now though, I do still use:\n- Microsoft (US) - keyboard\n- Logitech (Swiss) - mouse\n- Bose (US) - headphones\n\nIt's just a bit of cognitive dissonance for me bc for years I've never associated Chinese brands with quality (w/ the exception of Lenovo. And honestly, that's just bc I use ThinkPad, which they'd acquired from IBM). To me, quality always meant American, Japanese, or Korean. Or maybe a European country (for cars, for example). But I think that's changing now. Chinese brands are ascendant! A whole new generation of Americans are going to grow up regularly using TikTok, Shein, and Temu, thinking that Chinese companies are the cream of the crop. (And if American car companies weren't protected by US tariffs, BYD would likely be a huge Tesla competitor, I think.)\n\nAm curious though‚Äî what brands are ppl using nowadays? Do you see a shift towards Chinese ones?"

There's a huge difference!\n\nMaybe this is confirmation bias, but it honestly feels like a through line to me that everything is so much more regulated in Europe: GDPR, no AC at the Olympics, and scooter max speeds. I'm happy to be proved wrong though!\n\nQuestion: what is something that Europe is more laissez-faire ab, compared to America? \"ü§î\""

But then as an adult, I've noticed that I increasingly enjoy resting more if I have free time. Rather than mindlessly watch YouTube or go out just for the sake of going out, I increasingly prefer staying inside & collecting my thoughts or just letting my mind go blank altogether. Also, when I work I now listen to music less & less as well.\n\nI used to think that quiet time & space was a time to fill with activity. But now my powers of concentration need to be more... conserved & focused? It's almost as if any activity at all depletes me in some way. Even \"passive\" activities like listening to music.\n\nI can't speak for other men, but I wonder if this is a new trend that's happening. \"ü§î\""
