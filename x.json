And it is, in certain ways.\n\nBut as I've gotten older, I've also realized that being childfree is also akin to playing life on hard mode, in a few but important ways.\n\nWhen you have kids, the north star is clear. There's a clear priority for your life. And the structure's also clear. (Or at least, more clear.) For most ppl, everything is done in service of your family, with your kids being first. How much money you need to make. What kind of work you need to do to make that money. How much you need to save. All these kinds of constraints do tie you down, but they also give form & purpose to your life. They keep you grounded & tethered to reality.\n\nEvery day, if you have kids, by simply making it through the day, you have contributed to your children's development. You've answered their questions, fed them, and have helped them grow. Every day, even if you're purely moving through the world in a reactive mode, you've done something meaningful w/ your life. (Or at least, moved the needle forward in some small way. At very minimum, you're at least contributing to the future tax base of your country. You are contributing to a collective project, larger than yourself!)\n\nBut in the absence of children being the forcing function, childfree ppl need to be disciplined ab how they structure their life. Not for one day, one week, or one year. But for your entire life. Also, you have to make sure you're actually doing something w/ your life. When you're childless, it's easy to squander entire days without contributing anything to anyone."

First was my laptop yrs ago (Lenovo from Dell). Then my scooter (NIU). And now I'm considering an Open (OnePlus from Samsung). For yrs, everything was made in China (eg. your fancy MacBook) but then other companies just slapped their logo over it. But now I think China's finally getting into the international market w/ their own premium Chinese brands. (The other obvious example here is TikTok. But not me! Still on X. \"üôÇ\")\n\nAs of now though, I do still use:\n- Microsoft (US) - keyboard\n- Logitech (Swiss) - mouse\n- Bose (US) - headphones\n\nIt's just a bit of cognitive dissonance for me bc for years I've never associated Chinese brands with quality (w/ the exception of Lenovo. And honestly, that's just bc I use ThinkPad, which they'd acquired from IBM). To me, quality always meant American, Japanese, or Korean. Or maybe a European country (for cars, for example). But I think that's changing now. Chinese brands are ascendant! A whole new generation of Americans are going to grow up regularly using TikTok, Shein, and Temu, thinking that Chinese companies are the cream of the crop. (And if American car companies weren't protected by US tariffs, BYD would likely be a huge Tesla competitor, I think.)\n\nAm curious though‚Äî what brands are ppl using nowadays? Do you see a shift towards Chinese ones?"

Today, a firmware update finally released that allows it to now go 32 kph (20 mph). American mode! There's a huge difference!\n\nMaybe this is confirmation bias, but it honestly feels like a through line to me that everything is so much more regulated in Europe: GDPR, no AC at the Olympics, and scooter max speeds. I'm happy to be proved wrong though!\n\nQuestion: what is something that Europe is more laissez-faire ab, compared to America? \"ü§î\""

But then as an adult, I've noticed that I increasingly enjoy resting more if I have free time. Rather than mindlessly watch YouTube or go out just for the sake of going out, I increasingly prefer staying inside & collecting my thoughts or just letting my mind go blank altogether. Also, when I work I now listen to music less & less as well.\n\nI used to think that quiet time & space was a time to fill with activity. But now my powers of concentration need to be more... conserved & focused? It's almost as if any activity at all depletes me in some way. Even \"passive\" activities like listening to music.\n\nI can't speak for other men, but I wonder if this is a new trend that's happening. \"ü§î\""
