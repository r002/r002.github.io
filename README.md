# Robert's Curiosity Maze 🙋‍♂️

Back in December of 2023, I started using X for the first time and was blown away. I [discovered Maggie](https://twitter.com/robert_gpt/status/1743260664020279427) and reading through her astoundingly phenomenal site put me in such **an immense state of shame** re my own sad and pitiful personal site and writings that I immediately unlinked to all my stuff everywhere I could and set upon revamping my small corner of the internet.

I was already [familiar with Amelia](https://github.com/githubocto/repo-visualizer-demo/issues/1) from back in 2021 when I was doing more GitHub stuff and had at some point found [Andy's post about **"working with the garage door up"**](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu&stackedNotes=z7UeGpBpsZFWDmUq6VQgcB4TDfCUgxgXNuMvM) and [peripheral vision](https://twitter.com/robert_gpt/status/1743505268124594527).

Finally, I'd also found Anne-Laure on X. I consider myself a pretty curious person (which is sadly also one big reason my career has gone largely nowhere, alas 😭) but Anne-Laure may be the **only person on the internet** who is even ***more*** curious than I am. Literally, I'm pretty sure, every tweet I see from her is about curiosity! Every one! (And I've ❤'d them all!)

So anyway, for my new personal site, I wanted to build something that would capture [Amelia's infinite canvas idea](https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/evolving-the-infinite-canvas) with Andy's `path-dependency`/`peripheral vision idea` with Anne-Laure's general `"just-follow-your-curiosity"` idea and this **`"Curiosity Maze"`** is what I've come up with! 🤗

You still can't pan vertically yet, nor zoom in and out, but I think I have the fundamentals figured out. [Inspired by how Maggie made her own personal site public](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/maggieappleton.com-V2/blob/main/README.md), I've also gone ahead and done the same! Feel free to remix/reuse! 👍

A huge thanks to Maggie, Amelia, Anne-Laure, and Andy for being who you guys are and doing what you do! 🙏 I don't know you (and you guys don't know me) but I love how we live in an age where total strangers can connect with each other's work ***across space and time*** and have these weird asymmetrical relationships. You guys have no idea who I am but I've been hugely inspired by your work!! Thank you for sharing so generously with complete strangers on the internet!! 💙

Onward and upward!! Accelerate!! 🌎🚀✨
