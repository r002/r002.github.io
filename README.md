# An Ode to Tweeting Every Day 💬
### Saturday - April 6, 2024
As I've previously written, [I resolved on Jan 1, 2024 to make 2024 my year of connection](https://r002.github.io/?s=p0,p1,p2,p3). For years I'd always toiled away in private. With only rare exception, I'd been shy about my work, never really posting much at all publicly.

But discovering X in December 2023 honestly blew my mind. So many fascinating people on the internet! So many new topics to learn about every single day! I dug into the [learn in public mindset](https://twitter.com/robert_gpt/status/1743505266031612090) and was instantly sold.

So since [Jan 1](https://twitter.com/robert_gpt/status/1742031082495549650), for every single day in 2024, I've been tweeting publicly. At the time of this writing, I've tweeted 97 consecutive days. Some people write daily affirmations or pray every evening. I basically treat tweeting the same way. (I also think of it as **`community service`** too; I am [putting out vibes into the world of what I wish for the world to be!](https://twitter.com/robert_gpt/status/1744922931325534531)) To be sure, tweeting's not always easy, but like any habit, it gets easier the more you do it.

The simplest way for strangers on the internet to get to know you is by reading your tweets. So for the last 97 days, I've put forth little bits about myself every single day. They're not all profound, mind you. I've tweeted about my [favorite book of 2023](https://twitter.com/robert_gpt/status/1776015001842557037), my [favorite movie of all time](https://twitter.com/robert_gpt/status/1745614186271351199), a current [TV series I'm enamored with](https://twitter.com/robert_gpt/status/1775640957179789715), and [thoughts I had about a car accident](https://twitter.com/robert_gpt/status/1775640957179789715) I was unfortunately in last November. Sadly, [I won't be having children](https://r002.github.io/?s=p0) so these tweets will likely be all I leave behind once I go.

In the short time we're all here on earth together, I encourage everyone to be open, reach out, and connect with others. You gain nothing by walling yourself off from the world and marvelous wonders await if you'll just put yourself out there.

# Robert's Curiosity Maze 🙋‍♂️
### Monday - March 18, 2024

Back in December of 2023, I started using X for the first time and was blown away. I [discovered Maggie](https://twitter.com/robert_gpt/status/1743260664020279427) and reading through her astoundingly phenomenal site put me in such **an immense state of shame** re my own sad and pitiful personal site and writings that I immediately unlinked to all my stuff everywhere I could and set upon revamping my small corner of the internet.

I was already [familiar with Amelia](https://github.com/githubocto/repo-visualizer-demo/issues/1) from back in 2021 when I was doing more GitHub stuff and had at some point found [Andy's post about **"working with the garage door up"**](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu&stackedNotes=z7UeGpBpsZFWDmUq6VQgcB4TDfCUgxgXNuMvM) and [peripheral vision](https://twitter.com/robert_gpt/status/1743505268124594527).

Finally, I'd also found Anne-Laure on X. I consider myself a pretty curious person (which is sadly also one big reason my career has gone largely nowhere, alas 😭) but Anne-Laure may be the **only person on the internet** who is even ***more*** curious than I am. Literally, I'm pretty sure, every tweet I see from her is about curiosity! Every one! (And I've ❤'d them all!)

So anyway, for my new personal site, I wanted to build something that would capture [Amelia's infinite canvas idea](https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/evolving-the-infinite-canvas) with Andy's `path-dependency`/`peripheral vision idea` with Anne-Laure's general `"just-follow-your-curiosity"` idea and this **`"Curiosity Maze"`** is what I've come up with! 🤗

You still can't pan vertically yet, nor zoom in and out, but I think I have the fundamentals figured out. [Inspired by how Maggie made her own personal site public](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/maggieappleton.com-V2/blob/main/README.md), I've also gone ahead and done the same! Feel free to remix/reuse! 👍

A huge thanks to Maggie, Amelia, Anne-Laure, and Andy for being who you guys are and doing what you do! 🙏 I don't know you (and you guys don't know me) but I love how we live in an age where total strangers can connect with each other's work ***across space and time*** and have these weird asymmetrical relationships. You guys have no idea who I am but I've been hugely inspired by your work!! Thank you for sharing so generously with complete strangers on the internet!! 💙

Onward and upward!! Accelerate!! 🌎🚀✨
