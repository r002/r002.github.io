Personally, I'd like to but <a href='javascript:goto(\"p1n\");' class=\"cardLink\" data-state=\"p1n\">we just can't afford them</a>. 🙁\n</p>\n<p>\nTo be clear, maybe “cannot” is too strong a word.  I have a decent job and am grateful for it.  S is currently in grad school and we're hoping after she finishes and pays back all of her student debt that we'll be in better financial shape.  And when I look around, I certainly see many people with less choosing to have kids.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut by my own calculus, our current standard of living simply couldn't comfortably sustain children.  Note, our lifestyles are not extravagant.  One car (a decade-old Toyota) between the both of us and we eat out maybe once every 1-2 weeks.  No Starbucks habit or anything nonsensical like that.  We travel maybe a week once every year.  (Around S's birthday which has become our tradition. 💚)  We don't own a television; I don't drink, gamble, or follow sporting events.  I don't play Magic (a friend recently told me that he spends $200/mo on TMG!)\n</p>\n<p>\nDeciding to not have children opens some doors and closes others.  One very real challenge now is deciding exactly what to do with the rest of my life? 🤔 For many of my friends, their children have become their side quest (or maybe, their main quest?) that now occupies much of their time, energy, and attention (likely, for the next 18 years).\n</p>\n<p>\nBut for us, the childless, what am I to do with all of this time?\n</p>\n<p>\nI largely think of the decision to voluntarily not have children as being akin to <strong>“playing life on easy mode”</strong>.  So as I've been looking around, trying to figure out exactly what I want to do on easy mode, one idea which struck me is to create this blog.  Whatever knowledge or wisdom I may have imparted to my children, I am going to now instead channel all of that energy into sharing on this blog with random internet strangers.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo please do take a gander! Welcome to the Curiosity Maze that is my mind. 🎉\n</p>",
