What lifts your spirit. What makes you feel <em>alive</em>.        </p>        <p>          Sure, there's no single activity that doesn't wear thin over time. That's why it's important to have a good mix.        </p>        <p>          David Eagleman calls it the <a href=\"https://tim.blog/2023/05/29/david-eagleman-transcript\"><strong>\"lazy susan\"</strong></a> method of doing. As soon as an activity loses your interest, toggle to another.          As long as the activty is one of your true interests, you will eventually return to it (usually in short order, after a good night's sleep).          Life should be <strong><em>easy</em></strong>.  If it's hard, then you're trying to force something.  You're doing it wrong.        </p>        <div class=\"tweet-img\">          <img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJUTY3KWwAA2zM_?format=png&name=small\" />        </div>        <p>          What you're good at will come naturally to you.  Don't be judgmental and embrace your natural gravity.        </p>        <p>          Everyone possesses a natural gravity: a particular way of being that makes you feel light, free, and happy.  Embrace it.        </p>        <p>          Who you live life withâ€” that's the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsT0ExNMK3I\">\"copilot question\"</a> from <strong><em>Up in the Air</em></strong> when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsT0ExNMK3I\">George Clooney gives his famous speed to Danny McBride</a>:        </p>        <div class=\"youtube\">          <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TsT0ExNMK3I?si=sLjTqxFFm-MXk9h-\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>        </div>        <p>          Life is long.        </p>        <p>          Go through it with the right person.
