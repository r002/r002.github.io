  "body": "<p>\nI often think about this a lot; it’s a finding from Brookings from back in 2022 that lives rent-free in my head.  I’ve spoken with my friends who have kids and I think (in the US, at least) that this number is largely accurate.  Most of it apparently goes to daycare, preschool, and other kinds of schooling in the early years.  According to one coworker, it all adds up to a second mortgage!\n</p>\n<p>\nWhat is curious to me is that if S and I <a href='javascript:goto(\"p0n\");'>choose to not have kids</a>, then theoretically, we should be saving $18,000 a year?  What positively boggles my mind is how everyone else has somehow saved up so much more money than I have.  Over five years, I should have saved up $90,000! 🤯\n</p>\n<p>\n<del>One of my dreams is to own a Tesla Cybertruck. Elon Musk is a man of many faults but I do give him tremendous credit for having the sheer <em>chutzpah</em> to push Cybertruck into the world. As of today, the going-rate for one of these bad boys is $79,990.  I’m going to start saving up!  In five years, I should be able to afford one! 👍</del>\n</p><p><strong>Update, Feb 22, 2025:</strong> I don't want a Cybertruck anymore. Apparently, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-6PjMHfjBg&t=244s'>you can't use them in snow!</a> 🤦‍♂️  Now I'm saving up for a <a href='https://rivian.com/r1s'>Rivian R1</a> instead!! 🚙</p>",
